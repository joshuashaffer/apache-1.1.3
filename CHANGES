New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache functionality
(see also more detailed CHANGES file) in the source directory. For more
information, see http://www.apache.org/docs/1.1/

In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal performance
enhancements, Apache 1.1 has the following specific new user
features:

  *) Caching Proxy Server
       Apache can now act as an HTTP proxy server, allowing clients
       behind firewalls to use the server to access the outside world. In
       addition, it can cache documents it proxies, speeding up access to
       frequently requested documents.

  *) Filetype-based Script "Actions"
       You can now run CGI scripts whenever a file of a certion type is
       requested. Makes it much easier to execute scripts that process
       files.

  *) Support for Keep-Alive Persistent Connections
       Apache now has (optional) support for persistent connections, as
       defined by the HTTP/1.1 draft. This protocol, supported by a
       number of current HTTP servers and browsers (including Netscape
       Navigator 2.0) has been shown to increase speed of document
       transfer by up to 50% in certain cases.

  *) Customizable CGI Environment Variables (not in this release)
       New PassEnv and SetEnv directives allow you to modify the
       environment variables passed to CGI scripts

  *) CERN Metafile Support
       Now emulates the CERN httpd's support for metafiles containing
       additional HTTP headers to be supplied with a document.

  *) Redirect Now Usable in .htaccess Files
       The Redirect directive can now be used in .htaccess files when the
       FileInfo directive has been set on. This allows users to redirect
       parts of their directories without requiring CGI scripts

  *) Improved UserDir Directive (not in this release)
       Now supports the ability to point user's files (as specificed by
       URLs beginning with the "~" character) at directories other than
       those specified by the Unix password file.

  *) Minimal DNS Now Runtime Option
       New HostnameLookups server configuration directive can be used to
       turn On or  Off DNS lookups. This supercedes the -DMINIMAL_DNS
       compile-time configuration option.

  *) Listen to Multiple Addresses and Ports
       Using the new Listen directive, Apache can listen to more than one
       port and IP address, using the same configuration set.

  *) Anonymous HTTP Logins
       New options allow you to allow, using Basic HTTP Authentication,
       anonymous logins, like those of FTP. This allows you to collect
       email addresses of people accessing your site.

  *) File Owner Avialable to Included CGI Scripts
       Server-side includes that call CGI scripts will now set a
       USER_NAME environment variable that contains the owner of the file
       which included it.

  *) Improved Icons
       Thanks to Kevin Hughes, Apache's nifty color GIF icons for
       directory listings have been updated. In addition, the Powered by
       Apache (apache_pb.gif) logo has been included.

  *) Log Rotation
	New support utility to allow log rotation without shutting down the
	server. See support/rotatelogs.c.

NEW AUTHENTICATION MODULES:

Note: These modules are not compiled into the server by default, as
they require special support on the host system. They must be enabled
specifically in the Configuration file.

  *) Support for Unix DB Authentication - mod_db.c
       In addition to DBM support, Apache now contains optional support
       for Berkeley DB databases.

  *) mSQL Database Authentication - mod_auth_msql.html
       Support for the use of mSQL databases for user authentication via
       HTTP is now supported.
