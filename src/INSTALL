This release of Apache supports the notion of "optional modules".
However, the server has to know which modules are compiled into it, in
order for those modules to be effective; this requires generation of a
short bit of code ("modules.c") which simply has a list of them.

It is also necessary to choose the correct options for your platform.

To do this:

1) Copy the file "Configuration.tmpl" to "Configuration" and then edit
   "Configuration".  This contains the per-machine config settings of
   the Makefile, and also an additional section at the bottom which
   lists the modules which have been compiled in, and also names the
   files containing them.  You will need to:

   a) Select a compiler, and compilation options as appropriate to
      your machine.

   b) Uncomment lines corresponding to those optional modules you wish
      to include (among the Module lines at the bottom of the file),
      or add new lines corresponding to custom modules you have written.
      (See API.html for preliminary docs on how to do that).	

      Note that DBM auth has to be explicitly configured in, if you want
      it --- just uncomment the corresponding line.

2) Run the "Configure" script:

      % Configure
      Using 'Configuration' as config file
      %

   This generates new versions of the Makefile and of modules.c.  (If
   you want to maintain multiple configurations, you can say, e.g.,

      % Configure -file Configuration.ai
      Using alternate config file Configuration.ai
      % 

3) Type "make".

The modules we place in the Apache distribution are the ones we have
tested and are used regularly by various members of the Apache
development group.  Additional modules contributed by members or third
parties with specific needs or functions are available at
<URL:http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/>.  There are
instructions on that page for linking these modules into the
core Apache code.
