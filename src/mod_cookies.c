/* User Tracking Module
 *
 * This Apache module is designed to track users paths through a site.
 * It uses the client-side state ("Cookie") protocol developed by Netscape.
 * It is known to work on Netscape browsers, Microsoft Internet 
 * Explorer and others currently being developed.
 *
 * Each time a page is requested we look to see if the browser is sending
 * us a Cookie: header that we previously generated.
 *
 * If we don't find one then the user hasn't been to this site since
 * starting their browser or their browser doesn't support cookies.  So
 * we generate a unique Cookie for the transaction and send it back to
 * the browser (via a "Set-Cookie" header)
 * Future requests from the same browser should keep the same Cookie line.
 *
 * The cookie and request are logged to a file.  Use the directive
 * "CookieLog somefilename" in one of the config files to enable the Cookie
 * module.  By matching up all the requests with the same cookie you can
 * work out exactly what path a user took through your site.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1.  This code doesn't log the initial transaction (the one that created
 *     the cookie to start with).  If it did then the cookie log file would
 *     be bigger than a normal access log.
 * 2.  This module has been designed to not interfere with other Cookies
 *     your site may be using; just avoid sending out cookies with
 *     the name "Apache=" or things will get confused.
 * 3.  If you want you can modify the Set-Cookie line so that the Cookie
 *     never expires.  You would then get the same Cookie each time the
 *     user revisits your site.
 *
 * Mark Cox, mark@ukweb.com, http://www.ukweb.com/~mark/, 6 July 95
 *
 * 6.12.95  MJC Now be more friendly.  Allow our cookies to overlap with
 *              others the site may be using.  Use a more descriptive 
 *              cookie name.
 * 18.3.96  MJC Generate cookies for EVERY request no matter what the 
 *              browser.  We never know when a new browser writer will
 *              add cookie support.
 * 31.3.95 JimC Allow the log to be sent to a pipe.  Copies the relevant
 *              code from mod_log_agent.c.
 * 24.5.96  MJC Improved documentation after receiving comments from users
 *  4.7.96  MJC Bug, "else" missing since February caused logging twice
